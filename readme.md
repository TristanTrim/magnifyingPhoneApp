This is pretty broken right now.

I''ve gotten the kivy camera widget displaying pic that can change size based on a scrollbar.

It doesn''t work on android. I''ve looked at plyer and played around a bit with someones code snippit. It looks like this project is complex and will require more knowledge of camera stuff.
